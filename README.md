# 2D-Field-of-View
A implementation of a 2D FOV and detection mechanic for top-down stealth games. Did the first version in Unity 2018.3 and updated it to 2020.3.
This a project to test a mechanic and does not mean to be a game at all. There are three scenes, one for each test:
- Test vision interactions with Player, Enemy, and Objects.
- Some AI Behavior based on this fov mechanic.
- Some Patrol and patrol paths to view how AI movement interact with fov
